# Lantern-Project
The Repository for Lantern Modpacks

## Introduction
As a Minecraft player who enjoys playing on multiplayer servers, I have experienced firsthand the lag that can occur when playing with many players or building automatic farms. However, I also love the vanilla experience and want to maintain the core gameplay while improving performance and adding quality-of-life (QOL) features.

## Performance Boosts
Lanternize includes several mods that can help improve Minecraft's performance without changing the core gameplay. These mods are designed to optimize the game and reduce lag, especially when playing on servers with multiple players. Some of these mods include optimization tools that can reduce the load on the CPU and GPU, while others can help reduce the amount of memory that the game uses.

## Quality-of-Life (QOL) Features
In addition to performance boosts, Lanternize also includes several QOL features that can enhance the gameplay experience on multiplayer servers. These features are designed to make it easier to play with other players and improve communication. The main QOL features included in Lanternize are:

- Graphical improvements: The modpack includes graphical improvements, such as better bubbles and Optifine parity features for texture packs, which can enhance the overall visual experience of the game.
- Proximity voice chat: The modpack includes a proximity voice chat mod that allows players to communicate with others who are close to them in-game. This can make it easier to coordinate with team members or have more immersive conversations with other players.
- Cape Compatibility: The modpack includes a cape mod that allows you to see capes on players from multiple different sources in game, such as Optifine, Vanilla, and Cloaks+.

The goal of these features is to help enhance the overall gameplay experience, while not straying far from un-modded Minecraft, making it more enjoyable and immersive for players who love the vanilla Minecraft gameplay.

## Conclusion
If you're looking for a modpack that can provide some much-needed performance boosts for Minecraft without sacrificing the core gameplay, while also including some QOL features, then Lanternize could be the right choice for you. With a focus on optimization, enhanced graphics, and communication, this modpack can provide a smoother and more enjoyable experience for players who love the vanilla Minecraft gameplay.

## Notes On Versions
The Layout of each version released will go in this order, "Lize-Version-Patch/Release" Here is an example: 

Lize-1.19.4-R

- Lize stands for Lanternize but shortened
- Version is the version of the game that it has been released for, e.g. 1.19.4
- Patch/Release will be either an "R", which stands for "Release" or a "P" which stands for "Patch"
